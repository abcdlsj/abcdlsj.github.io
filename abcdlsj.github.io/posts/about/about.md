## Hello 👋

Hi, I'm **abcdlsj**, a nickname I picked up when I first started college. It doesn't really mean anything — I've just been using it since I stepped into the world of programming!

I love many things in the world, especially **animals**, **games**, **reading**, and **movies**.

## About Me

I like to do a lot of `small` projects and am interested in new technologies.

Currently, I work at [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/) as a backend developer.

## Contact
