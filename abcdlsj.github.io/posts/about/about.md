Hello everyone, I am __abcdlsj__.

I like to do a lot of `small` projects and am interested in new technologies.

~~Currently, I live in __Shenzhen__ and work for [Shopee](https://shopee.com/).~~
> ~~Our team use __OpenResty__ as the API gateway and __Go__ language to provide [Seller Centre](https://seller.shopee.co.id/) for millions of sellers in Shopee to manage and operate their shops.~~
> ~~sWe are also committed to developing the [Shopee Open Platform](https://open.shopee.com), which provides a stable and convenient authentication and authorization process to help individual developers or erp to run their shops.~~
